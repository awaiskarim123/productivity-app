# Productivity App - Backend Resume Descriptions

## Detailed Description

Developed a comprehensive RESTful API backend for a productivity tracking application using Fastify, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. Architected a modular, plugin-based system with Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations and efficient query management. Implemented secure JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation, password hashing using bcrypt, and token revocation mechanisms. Built core features including work session tracking with automatic duration calculation, focus session management supporting Pomodoro-style focus/break modes, task management with priority levels and soft deletes, habit tracking with streak calculation and daily logging, and a notes system with tagging and pinning capabilities. Developed a sophisticated analytics service that aggregates time data across daily, weekly, and monthly periods, calculates focus streaks based on user-defined goals, generates productivity trends with time-bucketed aggregations, and provides AI-driven suggestions for improving user productivity. Implemented comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas, environment configuration with type-safe validation, and database migrations with proper indexing for optimal query performance. Designed RESTful endpoints following REST principles with proper HTTP status codes, error handling, and response formatting. Integrated WebSocket support for real-time features and implemented CORS configuration for cross-origin resource sharing. The backend supports multiple productivity modules including work sessions, focus sessions, tasks, habits, notes, analytics, and motivation quotes, all with proper user isolation and data security measures.
